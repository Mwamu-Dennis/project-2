KARAMOJA PROJECT


Karamoja ia a food insecure region in Uganda.


I had been given the task to analyse the data as a data analyst for Dalberg Data Insights as they need to create a new food insecurity tool
to support the decision making for NGO'S in Karamoja region.

So as to analyse the data i had to create some research questions which are:

1)What is the total crop production per district?

2)What is the comparison between maize and sorghum production in the districts?

3)What is the total crop production per subcounty?

4)What is the district with the largest population and the land area and how they correlate with the crop production.

THE FINDINGS   

-Moroto and Kabim were the bdistricts with the lowest crop production.

-Nakapiripirit was the district with the highest maize production while Kotido was the district with the highest sorghum production.

-Kotido was the district with the highest crop production in Kramoja region.

-Kotido subcounty had the highest crop production while South Division Subcounty had the lowest crop production.

-Kaabong had the largest population and land but this did not correlate with the crop production.

RECOMMENDATIONS

-More scientific reserch to be done in Moroto and Kabim districts which were the worst doing subcounties.

-For Kaabong district the NGO'S can invest infarm inputs to the district which has a large population and lands to ensure there is a high produce.

-The NGO'S can dig boreholes and create water reservoirs in the district to ensure that drought does not hit the region hard.

-The NGO'S can also help the region with insecticides to control pests and diseases.
